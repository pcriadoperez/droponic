<p class="seqpara2"><span lang="EN-GB">Ideally, from a legal perspective, all users
would be asked to expressly agree to the terms of the document. However, in
practice, express consent is rarely sought from casual website visitors. On the
other hand, it is easy to obtain the express consent of users who register with
the website or submit any material to the website, e.g. by clicking "I
accept" on an electronic version of the document. You should retain
evidence of the acceptance of the document terms by each such user.</span></p>

<p class="seqpara2"><span lang="EN-GB">The use of websites by minors can be legally
problematic. There are a number of different legal issues. For example, under
English law, contracts may be unenforceable against minors. Another issue concerns
data protection. The law of data protection imposes additional burdens in
relation to the processing of any personal data of a minor and personal data
provided by a minor. The effects of the law of indecency may also depend upon
whether a website is accessible by minors. Obviously, the inclusion of a
requirement in your terms and conditions that minors refrain from using a
website is no guarantee that they will do so. Where your website is directed
at, or likely to be used by, minors, we recommend that you seek specialist
legal advice.</span></p>

of liability</span></b></p>

<p class="seqpara2"><span lang="EN-GB">Contractual limitations and exclusions of
liability are regulated and controlled by law, and the courts may rule that
particular limitations and exclusions of liability in contracts are
unenforceable.</span></p>

<p class="seqpara2"><span lang="EN-GB">The courts are particularly likely to
intervene where a party is seeking to rely on a limitation or exclusion of
liability in its standard terms and conditions, but will also sometimes
intervene where a term has been individually negotiated.</span></p>

<p class="seqpara2"><span lang="EN-GB">The courts may be more likely to rule that
provisions excluding liability, as opposed to those merely limiting liability,
are unenforceable.</span></p>

<p class="seqpara2"><span lang="EN-GB">If there is a risk that any particular
limitation or exclusion of liability will be found to be unenforceable by the
courts, that provision should be drafted as an independent term, and be
numbered separately from the other provisions.</span></p>

<p class="seqpara2"><span lang="EN-GB">It may improve the chances of a limitation
or exclusion of liability being found to be enforceable if the party seeking to
rely upon it specifically drew it to the attention of the other party before
the contract was entered into.</span></p>

<p class="seqpara2"><span lang="EN-GB">Exclusions and limitations of liability in
UK contracts are primarily regulated by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977
("UCTA").</span></p>

<p class="seqpara2"><span lang="EN-GB">Contracts regulated by UCTA cannot exclude
or restrict a party's liability for death or personal injury resulting from
negligence (Section 2(1), UCTA).</span></p>

<p class="seqpara2"><span lang="EN-GB">Except insofar as the relevant term
satisfies the requirements of reasonableness, such contracts cannot exclude or
restrict liability: (i) for negligence (which includes a breach of an express
or implied contractual obligation to take reasonable care or exercise
reasonable skill) (Section 2(2), UCTA); or (ii) for misrepresentation (Section
3, Misrepresentation Act 1967).</span></p>

<p class="seqpara2"><span lang="EN-GB">In addition, if a contract is regulated by
UCTA, and one of the parties is dealing on the other's written standard terms
of business, then except insofar as the relevant contractual term satisfies the
requirements of reasonableness the other party cannot: (i) exclude or restrict
his liability in respect of a breach of contract; or (ii) claim to be entitled
to render a contractual performance substantially different from that which was
reasonably expected of him; or (iii) claim to be entitled, in respect of the
whole or any part of his contractual obligation, to render no contractual
performance at all (see Section 3, UCTA).</span></p>

<p class="seqpara2"><span lang="EN-GB">UCTA includes various other restrictions,
particularly in the case of contracts for the sale of goods and contracts under
which possession or ownership of goods passes.</span></p>

<p class="seqpara2"><span lang="EN-GB">If you wish to try to limit/exclude for
liability in respect of reckless, deliberate, personal and/or repudiatory
breaches of contract, you should specify this in relation to the relevant
provision (for example, using the following wording: "The limitations and
exclusions of liability in this Clause [number] will apply whether or not the
liability in question arises out of any reckless, deliberate, personal and/or
repudiatory conduct or breach of contract"). In many circumstances,
however, the courts will find these types of limitations and exclusions to be
unenforceable.</span></p>

<p class="seqpara2"><span lang="EN-GB">Somewhat different rules apply to
limitations of liability in contracts with consumers, and these provisions
should not be used in relation to such contracts.</span></p>

<p class="seqpara2"><span lang="EN-GB">These guidance notes provide a very
incomplete and basic overview of a complex subject. Accordingly, you should
take legal advice if you may wish to rely upon a limitation or exclusion of
liability.</span></p>

<p class="seqpara2"><span lang="EN-GB">Do not delete this provision (except upon
legal advice). Without this provision, the specific limitations and exclusions
of liability in the document are more likely to be unenforceable.</span></p>

<p class="seqpara2"><span lang="EN-GB">Do you want to attempt to exclude all
liability for free services and information?</span></p>
